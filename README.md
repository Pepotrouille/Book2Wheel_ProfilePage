# Book2Wheel_ProfilePage

##Preview##
This preview has been done using Vuetify. You can see a preview by cloning the repository in local, using a bash terminal and running it. 
During my tests, I did it using the package manager npm, and running it in developper mode with the command:
```
npm run dev
```

##Progression##
The visual layout for PC has been done with the adapted components. The next steps to improve that needs to be done:

* Responsiveness depending on the device
* Absolute view elements on the avatar and cards
* Easily personalizable cards and reviews using arguments
* Implementation of a fonctional map using an external API
